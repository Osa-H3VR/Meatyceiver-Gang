# Meatyceiver-Gang

```
No sosigs in sight
Atleast no familiar ones
The only things you hear
Sound of metal replicants scraping
Robotic beeps of the turrets
Destroy the all the nodes
Free the world
Or rather what is left
```

## Description:
This set of characters is an idea that, at the same time, I wanted to create a Receiver inspired expierience, while also still giving it an original flair that goes well will both games. 
- *This one is my favorite!* Each of the characters is unique, and starts with his signature weapon. Learn to use it, remember guns dont grow on trees.
- Ammo is really limited, make each shot count!
- Each hold consists of only a shooting challenges, test not only your aim, but also reloading prowess and magazine management!
- Compete for the highest score with your friends and enemies (frenemies also?)
- Dangerous patrols, that are worth fighting if you're up for the challange.

##### NOTE: Highly recommending to use https://github.com/gommodore/H3VR.Meatyceiver2 with these characters

## Progression changes:
- Patrolling metal sosigs, they are almost indestructible, evading them is your top priority. If in a pinch, use you tools to distract them or to destroy them.
- Destroying them can yield big amount of ammo to use, and a hp restore, remember though, its really risky.
- Ammo can only be bought! I'm trying to balance it around Limited Ammo, but I hope Spawnlock will also be fun with additional patrols.
- Single hp crate per supply, only the minimum to keep you going.
- If you screw up, and are out of ammo during hold, no worries, you always get a free sosig with a mag or two that will spawn some time after the nodes start to be available.
Remember though, each seconds loses you points, so better come in prepared.
- Shops only sells high tier ammo (costly, you get less) low tier ammo (cheaper, you get more) and explosives to deal with those pesky replicants.

## Bugs:
- Turrets can, and will spawn knocked down
- On some maps, patrols like to congregate in small areas (Promeatus middle area is, I think, the worst offender for that)
- There is a bug in TnHTweaker (1.6.1), that will still give you useless shotgun ammo from Ammo Purchase station, should be fixed in next release (ty devyndamonster)
- Regenerative encryptions can be really annoying on some custom maps (Looking at you Island Compounds Warehouse, with your dumb celling beams)

## TODO:
- Can I just use the the robot sosigs from winter wasteland?
    - if they work
    - and actually have thier weakpoint
    - I just need to add higher hp and higher hearing and fov capacity

- Add a picture showing sentries weakpoints
    - Turrets were SO ANNOYING (to the point I was actually thinking about scrapping them) till I randomly found out they have a weakpoint, its that lower part of the thingy they have on their side, its colored depending on the turret type. The hitbox is really small. Im almost 100% sure its even smaller that in Receivers turrets.

- Endless mode:     (aka. "Give me all the nodes, give them NOW")
    - I heard you like shooting nodes? Now each hold will spawn RANDOM AMOUNT of completely RANDOM COMBINATION of nodes.
    - The same amout of tokens after each hold
    - Patrols more abdundant, and geared to the metal... teeth... claws... Yeah, that works.
    
- Thumbnail pls?
    - :3

- Keep track of best scores in the repo?
    - for that sweet, sweet clout.
    
## BONUS:
```
Maybe you want to create your own Meatyceiver character?
Maybe you really love Llock and you think its the best pistol in the game?
Your hunger for shooting nodes is still unfulfilled and you need more?

**INTRODUCING: CHARACTER_GENERATOR.PS1**

I've included a simple powershell script that I personally use to create the characters themselves!

The output then can be additionally modified to your liking, to really put **U** in "Yo**U**r character". 

<TODO:Describe how to use it>
